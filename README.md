## Members' Contributions

### Member 1: User Interface
The UI folder contains Windows Forms components for the clinic management desktop application. It includes a login form and role-specific dashboards (Doctor, Receptionist, Admin) to handle different user interactions. The AdminDashboard is implemented using partial classes for better code organization, separating concerns like doctor management, patient registration, and scheduling into dedicated files. Controllers within the AdminDashboard facilitate interaction between the UI and business logic layers. Resource files (.resx) store UI elements and strings, contributing to the folder's complexity and density.
